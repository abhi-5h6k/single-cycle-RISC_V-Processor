üìò  Single-Cycle RISC-V Processor (RV32I) in Verilog

üß© Introduction

This project implements a Single-Cycle RISC-V Processor, adhering to the RV32I instruction set architecture (ISA), in Verilog HDL. The processor is designed to complete one instruction per clock cycle, providing a simplified but complete model for instruction execution without pipelining or hazard detection. It serves as a foundational building block for understanding modern CPU architecture and is suitable for educational and prototyping purposes.

üß† Architectural Overview

The architecture consists of several synchronous and combinational modules, interconnected to fetch, decode, execute, and write results within a single clock cycle. Each instruction is executed in exactly one clock cycle, regardless of complexity.

Major stages in the datapath:

Instruction Fetch (IF) ‚Äì PC fetches the instruction from memory.

Instruction Decode (ID) ‚Äì Decoding, register file reading, and immediate extraction.

Execute (EX) ‚Äì ALU performs the computation.

Memory Access (MEM) ‚Äì Load/store instructions interact with memory.

Write Back (WB) ‚Äì ALU/memory result written back to the register file.

üß± Module Descriptions

üîπ 1. Program Counter (program_counter)
Holds the address of the current instruction.

Updates every cycle to either PC + 4 (next sequential instruction) or branch target if branch condition is met.

üîπ 2. PC Adder (pc_adder)
Adds 4 to the current PC to fetch the next instruction.

üîπ 3. Branch Adder (branch_adder)
Calculates the target address for conditional branches using the immediate offset.

üîπ 4. PC Mux (pc_mux)
Chooses between the next sequential PC and the branch target based on the Branch and Zero control signals.

üîπ 5. Instruction Memory (Instruction_Memory)
A ROM array containing 32-bit instructions.

Preloaded with R-, I-, S-, B-, U-, and J-type instructions to test the functionality.

üîπ 6. Register File (Register_File)
32 general-purpose 32-bit registers.

Supports simultaneous read of two source registers and write-back to a destination register.

üîπ 7. Control Unit (main_control_unit)
Decodes the instruction opcode and generates control signals such as:

RegWrite: Enable writing to a register.

ALUSrc: Choose between immediate or register operand.

MemRead: Enable memory read.

MemWrite: Enable memory write.

MemToReg: Choose between ALU result or memory data for writing back.

Branch: Enable branching.

ALUOp: Informs ALU control how to interpret funct fields.

üîπ 8. Immediate Generator (immediate_generator)
Extracts and sign-extends immediate fields from various instruction formats:

I-type, S-type, B-type, U-type, and J-type.

üîπ 9. ALU Control (ALU_Control)
Interprets funct3, funct7, and ALUOp to generate a 4-bit signal to configure the ALU operation.

üîπ 10. ALU (ALU)
Executes arithmetic and logical operations such as:

ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR, SLL, SRL, SRA, SLT

Outputs result and a zero flag for branching.

üîπ 11. ALU MUX (MUX2to1)
Chooses between register operand or immediate operand based on ALUSrc.

üîπ 12. Data Memory (Data_Memory)
Memory array supporting word-addressed read and write.

Used for load (lw) and store (sw) instructions.

üîπ 13. Write-Back MUX (MUX2to1_DataMemory)
Chooses the value to be written back to registers:

From ALU or from Data Memory depending on MemToReg.
